'Some notes about Issuable Documents, the fields of IssuableDocumentsT and how they help to construct reports

'Field Main_Product_Entity_Debited(For_Product_Documents) is for documents that are issued in commercial sector and have product details.
'Field notes in the table design view,have the following info ""YES" MEANS THAT COMPANY BUYS OR TRANSFERS IN PRODUCTS. "NO" MEANS THAT COMPANY SELLS OR TRANSFERS OUT PRODUCTS.
'WHEN MAIN ENTITY IS DEBITED, THIS APPLIES FOR PRODUCT BUT ALSO FOR THE FINANCIAL TRANSLATION OF THE PRODUCTDETAILS RECORD. SAME IF CREDITED..."_
'So, to have a wider view of the above compressed notes, please read the following:
'We use this field in reporting, to extract two main informations, in coperation with the field "Affects Inventory" of the same table and in coperation with
'IssuedDocuments's Intention Type - its foreign key (Affects Ownership field).
'In general, company needs to extract the following informations:
'a) which of her entities warehouses, production lines, employees etc have products in their hands and how many
'b) Which products and of what quantity has the company under its possession(ownership) (no matter if they are in hands of any of company's entity or are being owed from or to any 3d party (non company's transactor)

'So, as we can understand, it is not rare to find that there are in hands of company's transactors products that are not in company's possesion(ownership) (this can occur if a supplier sends us products
'just with a transport document, without invoicing them). This means that possesion (ownership) of the goods is still on supplier but the products are in our hands.
'Of course the opposite can occur, for example supplier may have invoiced us for goods that he has not send to us yet and they are not in any of our company's transactors hands.
'So, we use the following pattern in reporting (taking into account that in table IssuableDocumentT, field Used_In_Commercial_Sector is true and field Has_Product_Details is true also) :

'Document affects inventory | Main_Product_Entity_Debited(For_Product_Documents) | intention type (Affects Ownership field)   |Ownership product result | Products In company's transactor hands result

'Field Main_Financial_Entity_Debited(Commercial_Sector) is for documents that are issued in commercial sector and have financial details, no matter if they have product details.
'So, this field regulates if the main financial transactor(or transactors if they are many, like bank, cash, credit card etc) is debited or credited. Probably the name of the field is not
'correct, and should be better "Other_Financial_Entity_Debited(Commercial_Sector)" as the case will be that other financial entity will always be one transactor, but it is ok, this is
'not a big problem, it works as it is, by letting us know what Other Financial entity does by informing us what main entity financial transactor does.
'We must keep in mind that this most of the time regulates documents (or part of them, like invoice with receipt) that do have money transactions.
'It does not regulate in any way how the product details records are being transformed to financial records (they are being transformed using the table "LinkProductsToCompanyFinancialTransactorsT"
'following the debit/credit pattern that comes from field "Main_Product_Entity_Debited(For_Product_Documents)" of IssuableDocumentsT
'So the financial transactor that will be selected from table LinkProductsToCompanyFinancialTransactorsT for each Product Details record, will be debited or credited similarly as
'the Main_Product_Entity did in this specific Product Details record.
